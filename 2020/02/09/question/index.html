<p>I co-authored a short guide book with my master supervisor on academic thesis writing, where encompassing the whole steps of academic research, such as finding research questions, research design, statistical analysis and thesis construction. In this blog, I would like to summarize some materials that I collected and hope it to inspire more people. This part corresponds to Chapter 3: How to identify research questions.  </p>
<p><font color="red">A good research question is the half battle of an academic thesis.</font> Thus, we cannot emphasize too much the importance of an innovative and interesting question. </p>
<h5 id="1-What-is-an-interesting-question-or-theory"><a href="#1-What-is-an-interesting-question-or-theory" class="headerlink" title="1. What is an interesting question or theory"></a>1. What is an interesting question or theory</h5><p><a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/004839317100100211?journalCode=posa" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Davis (1971)</a> has a fantastic description of what is an interesting question, because he thinks “<em>a theorist is considered great, not because his theories are true, but because they are interesting</em>”. Thus, what are interesting theories look like? He unpacked the components of interesting propositions and gave us an abstract formulation:</p>
<table><tr><td bgcolor="yellow">“What seems to be X is in reality non- X” or “What is accepted as X is actually non-X”.</td></tr></table>

<p>That is to say:   </p>
<p>(Ⅰ) Articulate what we have been agree with or taken for granted   </p>
<p>(Ⅱ) Deny what we have been traditionally accepted   </p>
<p>(Ⅲ) Verify the old propositions are wrong and prove your new ones are right   </p>
<p>(Ⅳ) Figure out the future directions on how to employ these new propositions.    </p>

<h5 id="2-Where-could-we-identify-these-research-questions"><a href="#2-Where-could-we-identify-these-research-questions" class="headerlink" title="2. Where could we identify these research questions?"></a>2. Where could we identify these research questions?</h5><p>Research questions mainly come from two sources: from <strong><em>existing literature</em></strong>, <strong><em>daily life experiences</em></strong> (observations; chat with others; personal experiences). In this part, we will first talk about how to formulate research questions from the existing literature.</p>
<p><a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1350508410372151" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sandberg and Alvesson (2011)</a> developed a typology of how scholar identify research questions from existing literature. He pointed out that spotting gaps in previous literature was the most frequently used approaches. Specifically, several gap-spotting modes are identified, I would take recent literature in communication as examples.  In most cases, scholars might combine different gap-spotting strategies to form research questions.</p>
<h6 id="2-1-Confusing-spotting-find-competing-explanations"><a href="#2-1-Confusing-spotting-find-competing-explanations" class="headerlink" title="2.1 Confusing spotting: find competing explanations"></a>2.1 Confusing spotting: find competing explanations</h6><p>“<em>Despite the evidence for partisan selective exposure, questions remain about the causal mechanisms that underlie the phenomenon. <font color="red">Many studies have employed cognitive dissonance theory</font> as a causal explanation (…) <font color="red">An alternative explanation</font> for partisan selective exposure comes from news consumers’ evaluations of the credibility of a news source and/or the information within news stories.</em>”    </p>
<h6 id="2-2-Neglect-spotting-find-an-overlooked-area"><a href="#2-2-Neglect-spotting-find-an-overlooked-area" class="headerlink" title="2.2 Neglect spotting: find an overlooked area"></a>2.2 Neglect spotting: find an overlooked area</h6><p>“<em>Prior research has revealed that young people’s exposure to mass media leads to stronger materialism through cultivation processes . (…) Surprisingly, <font color="red">little is known</font> about how <font color="red">young people’s use of SNSs</font> is associated with their consumption experience and materialism.</em>“  </p>
<p>“<em>A few studies have examined the effects of visual cues in crisis communication, such as a spokesperson’s race, facial features, or the use of powerful gestures. <font color="red">Research on vocal cues in crisis communication, however, is limited</font> to one study that examined the impact of only one vocal cue (voice pitch) on the perceptions of a spokesperson.</em>“  </p>
<h6 id="2-3-Neglect-spotting-add-additional-factors"><a href="#2-3-Neglect-spotting-add-additional-factors" class="headerlink" title="2.3 Neglect spotting: add additional factors"></a>2.3 Neglect spotting: add additional factors</h6><p>“<em>Furthermore, both expectation states and role congruity theories predict that status differentiation is most robust… However, this work was focused on the effects of linguistic style (i.e., speech assertiveness vs. tentativeness) on influence; <font color="red">researchers have yet</font> to consider how <font color="red">identity salience</font> moderates the effect of nonverbal behaviors on social influence.</em>“  </p>
