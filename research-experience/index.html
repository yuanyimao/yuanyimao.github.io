<p>Over the past two and a half years of my graduate study at <a href="http://en.sjtu.edu.cn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shanghai Jiao Tong University</a>, I have co-authored several papers with my supervisor, Dr. Wu Li on online pro-social behaviors from psychological perspectives.  </p>
<p>Social media has not only become new ways of communication among Chinese citizens but also creates the channel for the interaction among donors, charitable organizations and recipients.   </p>
<p>For instance, the Chinese mobile web app charitable crowdfunding service, <strong><a href="https://gongyi.qq.com/succor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tencent gongyi</a></strong> (some extent be similar to <a href="www.gofundme.com">GoFundMe</a>) was one of the most successful platforms for soliciting micro-donations ( <a href="https://www.ritachou.com/project-tencent-charity-in-wechat" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more detailed description see here</a> ).  </p>
<p><img src="/research-experience/index/im5.JPG" alt="screen shot of Tencent gongyi"></p>
<p>People can donate to one of the charitable projects through the mobile web app using WeChat payment and will receive notification messages of the progress updates that explain where will the money go and how will the money be used. Tencent gongyi also allows users to share their projects with people through integrated social network links (e.g., WeChat moment, Sina micro-blog).     </p>

<p>Understanding the nature of human’s altruistic act has been a core pursuit of science. Although there has been plenty of research on exploring people’s offline prosocial behavior, so far individual’s online prosocial behavior has received little research attention.  </p>
<p>Thus, this project aims to understand Chinese people’s online pro-social behavior (e.g., online donation behavior). Specifically, we have examined what are the psychological factors that impact people’s intention to donate online, how message narratives change the people’s willingness to donate online and what are the psychological effects on the online pro-social behavior.  </p>
<p>For example, as I mentioned above, social media provides channels with nonprofits to audiences to disclose how their contributions are used, which is an important factor that affects people’s decision making on donation. Thus, we conducted a 2 (message framing: gain/loss) × 2 (progress updates: presence/absence) between-subjects factorial experiment.    </p>
<p><img src="/research-experience/index/im6.JPG" alt="results of experiment"></p>
<p>Results showed that positively framed messages are more effective in persuading individuals to donate online than negatively framed messages, and that the effect was more pronounced with the presence of progress updates (e.g., campaign status).  </p>
